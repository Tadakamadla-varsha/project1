    <h3>Vegetarian</h3>
    <p>vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat(red meat, poultry, seafood and the flesh of any other animal),and many also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter. Vegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons.Many people object to eating meat out of respect for sentient life.Such ethnical motivations
        have been codified under various religious beliefs, as well as animal rights advocacy. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic, economic,or personal preference.There are variations of the diet as well: an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and diary products, an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not diary
        products, and a lacto-vegetarian diet includes diary products but not eggs.A vegan diet excludes all animal products, includes eggs and diary.Some vegans also avoid other animal products such as beeswax,leather or silk clothing, and goose-fat shoe polish.
